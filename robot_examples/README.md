In this directory there are examples of client Robots contacting the server using the REST API.

Many of these examples contain a REST communication library that can be used as base also for other custom robots. In case there are improvements to the base communication library, they should be reported back to this repository.

Up to date the reference implementation is Python. Other REST API interfaces are automatically derived using Swagger, but they are not tested, and no high-level features are added to them.
